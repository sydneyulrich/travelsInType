    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="introduction">The 14th century was an era of distress for Europe, with the Hundred Years War beginning in
        1337 due to the French-English Edward III making claims to the French throne, and the Black Plague, which wiped out
        25 million people in Europe alone, approximately one third of the population at the time. But the period also
        ushered in distinct identities of art among regions, and the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance. In the midst of all
        of this, distribution of knowledge, religion and art continue to thrive. Particularly, in this time period, the
        Book of Hours, a prayer book, not only thrived, but spread rapidly. Because of this, many books of hours still exist
        today, but few are as ornamental or diverse as Jean Pucelle’s Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux. A masterpiece in many ways, the
        book uses ornamentation of initials, illustrations, and writing without being overly gaudy.</p>

        <div class="caption1">FIGURE 1: Example page from the Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, 1324, Paris, now featured in the Met
            Museum in NYC. The first two sentences reading "Deus, in adiutorium meum intende.
            Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina." This translates to the call "O God, come to my assistance. O Lord, make
            haste to help me." A historiated inital the the top depicts a man playing a triangle.
            Sentences are separated with marginalia of men playing instruments or holding weapons, as well as capitla

    <h2>Thesis</h2>
    <p class="thesis">To what extend did the different European cultures inform the design of the Hours of Jeanne
        d’Evreux
        and what makes it so unique for its time?</p>

    <h2>Book of Hours</h2>
    <p class="boh">A book of hours is a medieval prayer book used by nonclergy for devotion. Typically, it contains
        eight
        sets of devotions meant to be prayed throughout the day beginning with Matins at midnight and ending with
        Compline
        at nine pm. This part of the book is referred to as the Hours of the Virgin and is the most important aspect of
        the
        book. Alongside this can be any number of texts, from a calendar, gospel lessons, prayers to saints, to psalms
        of
        penitence. </p>
    <div class="line2"></div>

    <div class="imageHolder2">
        <img id="figure2" src="images/bohBasic.jpg" width="100%"
             alt="page from Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, depicting the Miracle of the Breviary"/>
        <div class="caption2">FIGURE 2: Example page from Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, 1324, Paris, now featured in the MET Museum,
            NYC.
            The page refers to Sextam, the Hour of the Virgin taking place at noon. The text starts with the same latin
            words as
            Figure 1. The page continues in saying "Gloria Patri, et Filio: et Spiritui sancto. Sicut erat in pricipio,
            et nunc, et semper..."
            which translates to Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost. Even as it was in the
            beginning,
            and now, and ever..." Many of the hours begin in just the same way. Alongside the text can be seen monks,
            instrumentalists,
            animals and other drolleries which separate the text and circle around the text to draw the readers eyes
            back in.

<div class="page four">
    <h2>Who was Jeanne d'Evreux?</h2>
    <p class="who">Jeanne d’Evreux was the queen of France and third wife to Charles IV. Married in 1324, they were
        married
        just four years before his death in 1328. She gave him three daughters and no male heirs despite being just 14
        when
        they were married. She is said to have been incredibly interested in the church, the Dominican order holding a
        particularly close place in her heart. The King reportedly gifted her Pucelle’s Book of Hours as a wedding or
        coronation gift.</p>
    <div class="line2"></div>

</div>

<div class="page five">
    <h2>Who was Jean Pucelle?</h2>
    <p class="who2">Jean Pucelle, reported to have lived in Paris from 1320 to 1334, was a famous illustrator for the
        time
        period. It is unknown where he was born, or what his life looked like outside of these dates, but his impact on
        illuminated manuscripts in this period was undoubtable. Whether he created them himself or not, any manuscript
        coming
        from France in this period, which used a similar style to Pucelle’s was referred to as a Pucelle. </p>
    <div class="line2"></div>

</div>

<div class="page six">
    <h2>The Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux</h2>
    <p class="hours">The book itself is small, only 94 x 64 mm and uses gossamer-thin parchment. The book is over 200
        pages,
        with 25 full page paintings rendered in grisaille, a technique using black and white shading. Most pictures are
        colorless, with only backgrounds featuring color. Written in the Gothic Textura, it also features historiated
        initials
        and marginalia and drolleries (Figure 3). This book is personalized specifically for the Queen, opening with a
        calendar, followed
        by the Hours of the Virgin, the Hours of Saint Louis (an ode to her ancestor renowned for his charity to the
        poor and
        sick) and lastly, the Seven Penitential Psalms and the Litanies.</p>
    <div class="line2"></div>

        <div class="caption3">FIGURE 3: Pictured is a full spread, recto and verso, from Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, 1324 ad, Paris,
            now
            at the MET Museum in NYC. Once again, we see page dividers in the form of medieval drolleries, as well as
            an historiated initial on the left side. The text uses Gothic Textura Rotunda, which bold stands out against
            soft flourishes and linear line dividers. This excerpt is from the Psalmus David. Seemingly, the marginalia
            in
            this instance is unrelated to the text itself.

<div class="page seven">
    <h2>Why is it unique?</h2>
    <p class="unique">Despite being one of the most common books of the time, Pucelle’s work is highly unusual. Whereas
        a scribe, illustrator, art director of sorts and others would comprise a team working on a book of this
        magnitude, Jean
        Pucelle worked with one unknown scribe and completed the initials and all illustrations himself. Though it was
        traditional to feature an illustration of the Infancy of Christ at the start of each hour, Pucelle opts to also
        feature a
        page of the Passion of Christ alongside it, as a duality between the life and death and said to mimic the joys
        and
        sorrows of the Virgin (Figure 4). Moreover, being on the heels of moveable type and towards the end of scribal
        manuscripts, the era of illuminated manuscripts brought with it a language of illustrations, script, page
        layouts and marginalia.
        Moreover, isolation within regions led to slow innovation and thus, design styles were distinct among areas and
        countries.
        However, what makes the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux unique, at least in part, is Pucelle’s blend of cultural
        influences from several different countries into one piece. He uses Italian, Netherland, French and Strasbourg
        influence
        all in one piece. The exactness with which he does this suggests he must have visited each of these countries to
        have the
        knowledge to be able to pull inspiration from these cultures. Moreover, he chooses in many places to blend text
        and image
        whether through motif, or through proximity as can be seen in Figure 5. </p>
    <div class="line2"></div>


    <div class="imageHolder4">
        <img id="figure4" src="images/joysAndSorrows.jpg" width="100%"
             alt="juxtaposition of a Passion and Infancy scene on one page in Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux"/>
        <div class="caption4">FIGURE 4: Another except from the Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, 1324, Paris, now at the MET Musuem. This
            spread is an example of the juxtaposition between an illustration of the Passion of Christ and the Infancy
            of Christ.
            Specifically, the left depicts Christ on a cross with the letters INRI written. This comes from the Latin
            phrase
            "Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum" meaning Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. To the right is depicted the
            scene
            in which the three kings adorn the Christ child with gifts. Below, are the words "Deus, ad sextam, in
            adiutorium."
            As aforementioned, this traditionally opened up a book of hours, and here is no exception. A historiated D
            explicitly
            interacts with the scene above it, featuring a groom holding a horse of the three kings. In the bottom
            margin, King
            Herod can be seen ordering a massacre of the Innocents, part of the story of the Infancy of Christ as well.
            The text
            coincides as well, with the following pages pleading for protection and defense from foes.

            writer of the text.
            A quill pen can be seen in his right hand finishing a sentence. This clever usage of marginalia refutes
            Mikhail Bahktin's point
            that drolleries and text live "side by side, but never merge" in medieval text. This closeup is yet another
            page in the
            Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, circa 1324, Paris, now housed at the MET Museum in NYC.

<div class="page eight">
    <h2>Italian Influence</h2>
    <p class="italian">One of the most attributed influences in Pucelle’s work is considered the Italian influence.
        First and foremost, usage of grisaille and perspective was first done in a painting by an Italian in the 13th
        century.
        Pucelle also uses grisaille in his book in illustrations, with tonal gradations, suggested to help indicate the
        emotional depth of the scene as well as provide a three-dimensional view. He paints the backgrounds with color
        to push
        this further (Figure 6). It is suggested that this is a result of the influence of Italian Trecento Art on
        Pucelle. Inspiration isn't
        limited to this, however. Pucelle pulls from the work of Sienese painter Duccio’s Maestà, made for the Siena
        Cathedral in 1311. The
        Annunciations, Crucifixions and Entombment all show correlation to Duccio’s masterpiece (Figures 7).
        Moreover, he pulls inspiration from Giotto’s Arena Chapel frescoes and Giovanni Pisano’s Massacre of the
        Innocents. Discussion and
        details on how Pucelle's work mimic precisely the work of these Italian greats, spans far beyond the scope of
        this website and its focus on the combination of text and image, but it is important to note that Pucelle uses
        Duccio, Giotto, and Pisano’s masterpieces and combines it with a distinct French style to create a new
        convention for
        French Gothic art. Furthermore, it is his merging of the cultures in a time period where this type of
        interaction is slow to form.</p>
    <div class="line2"></div>

    <div class="imageHolder6">
        <img id="figure6" src="images/grisaille.jpg" width="100%" alt="Flight into Egypt in Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux, with text that roughly
        translated to Lord, help us"/>
        <div class="caption6">FIGURE 6: Grisaille is a technique which uses tonal variations in light and shadow using only grays
            and blacks to give a three dimensionality to a piece. This piece expands the technique, featuring pockets of
            color primarily in the background of the image providing further depth. Giotto also used grisaille in his
            work
            with the Arena chapel, one of Pucelle's many Italian Trecento influences. Text below the Infancy of Christ
            image, once again opens up an
            Hour of the Virgin, with the traditional "Deus in adiutorium." The scene is a reference to the Flight into
            Egypt, with
            the Virgin, clutching the Christ child. It is said that Pucelle used this emotional imagery and
            three-dimensionality to
            spur emotion the reader and bring gravity to the prayer being read.

        <img id="figure7" src="images/duccioAnnunication.jpg" width="100%" alt="Duccio's Annunciation"/>
        <div class="caption7">FIGURE 7: In referencing Figure 9 below, there are instant parallels between Pucelle's
            Annunciation and this,
            Duccio's Annunciation, once part of a double-sided altarpiece, the Maesta, on the high altar of Siena's
            Cathedral, 1311 ad.
            It now resides in the National Gallery. Though this contains no text, it's relevance to Pucelle's work is
            striking and cannot be ignored.
            Architecturally, the pieces are similar, though Pucelle's occupies much less space. They use architecture to
            provide spatial depth. Both feature the Angel Gabriel crossing the
            threshold of the door. The sculptural, three-dimensional quality to Pucelle's scene is also reminscent of
            Duccio's.
        </div>
    </div>

</div>

<div class="page nine">
    <h2>French and Netherlandish Influence</h2>
    <p class="french">Like many French manuscripts of the time, the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux features initials,
        historiated initials, borders and drolleries. However, Pucelle also seems to grasp the importance of luxury
        and art to Parisians, often linked to female beauty. He employs figure styles which focus on elegance and refinement.
        For example, the Virgin in the devotional Tabernacle (Figure 8) and the Virgin in Annunciation from Hours of Jeanne
        d’Evreux (Figure 9) both demonstrate an S curve to their forms. Whereas the Virgin in the former features a baby Christ
        in her arms, the latter depicts a book representing the Word of God in her arms. The text itself uses Gothic Textura,
        and in particular what seems to be Gothic Textura Rotunda. Rotunda differentiates itself with a cursive bottom of the
        minims, allowing for a faster speed. This script style was common to the region and period, thanks to the efficiency
        with which a scribe could write. In fact, it was approximately two times faster than the prior Carolingian method.
        Where text and image meet are in the margins of text. Drolleries and marginalia act as a way of drawing the reader
        in and back to the text, the books primary focus and reason for devotion. The figures inspire mystery and spirituality,
        and act as punctuation and line dividers.</p>
    <div class="line2"></div>

    <div class="imageHolder8">

        <div class="caption8">FIGURE 8: This polyptych, Virgin in Tabernacle is 14th century French work featured at the MET Museum.
            The curve of the Virgin's body directly imitates that of Pucelle's Annunciation scene. However, the Virgin Mary can be seen holding
            a baby on her hip in this scene, whereas in Pucelle's work, there is the Word of God on her hip. This matronly form
            is representative of the role of the Virgin.</div>

            the MET Museum in NYC. Again, we notice the S curve of her body, achieved in sculptural form with the tabernacle
            piece in Figure 8. The text below the scene reads "Domine labia mea aperies,” or, O Lord, open though my lip. The passage would continue in saying "and my mouth will shew forth thy praise."
        </div>
    </div>

</div>
<div class="page nineB">
    <h2>French and Netherlandish Influence Continued</h2>
    <p>
        Marginalia, common to Netherlandish, English and French cultures, in the Hours of Jeanne d’Evreux act as one of
        the most extraordinary aspects of the book. They inspire medieval fascination, and while most “exist side by
        side but never merge” as suggested by Mikhail Bahktin, they do in face interact with the text. Page layout is dictated and divided by
        these drolleries. Though we today don’t understand fully the meaning behind these illustrations, some seem to
        have served as morals and others as references to well-known figures. For example, a historiated D initial, features a
        kneeling Queen Jeanne d’Evreux herself, with her lap dog and major domo behind. Inside the letter, a bearded
        monster is depicted (Figure 10). Other drolleries are references to the text itself. One example can be reportedly be
        found in Psalmus David, in which, on the opposite page, a man is depicted with a sling referencing Goliath. Another example appears
        in the August Calendar, in which a figure flings the words instead of wheat, as was common for the month. Most
        importantly though, these figures served to direct the reader back to the words of devotion and prayer.</p>
    <div class="line2"></div>

    <div class="imageHolder10">
        <img id="figure10" src="images/closeUp.jpg" width="100%" alt="Closeup of the historiated D, with Queen Jeanne d'Evreux and her dog in the middle"/>
        <div class="caption10">FIGURE 10: Pictures is a close up of the text of Figure 9, the Annunciation page. Within the D, is
            Jeanne d'Evreux herself, reading the book of hours and most probably "shewing forth [the Lord's] praise, as the
            passage of text suggests. To her left, she is protected by a guard. An angel acts as a line break for the text.</div>
    </div>

</div>

<div class="page ten">
    <h2>Strasbourg Influence</h2>
    <p class="strasbourg">In the Passion cycle, several motifs are comparable to the tympanum of the primary door at the
        Strasbourg Cathedral. (Figure 11). One motif is the incorporation of Black Africans depicted as tormentors of Christ. Another motif is
        unmistakably linked to Strasbourg. In the Crucifixion, an arm can be seen outstretched as if trying to support the Cross. In
        the same scene in the Strasbourg tympanum, an arm also reaches out to hold the cross that Christ is carrying. At
        this time, the legend of Christ’s Passion was depicted this way only in Strasbourg (Figure 12). </p>
    <div class="line2"></div>


    <div class="imageHolder11">
        <img id="figure11" src="images/crucifixion.jpg" width="100%" alt="view of the Crucifixion scene in Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux"/>
        <div class="caption11">FIGURE 11: Despite there being no text, this page from the Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux is an important one.
        Its direct connection to the Strasbourg Cathedral, places the artist Pucelle as having been not only to Italy, France and
        the Netherlands, but also to have been in Strasbourg for a period. This allowed him to pull from many different cultures,
        all which viewed religion and the church in different manners. This allowed him to pull from the written prayers and provide
        deeper context and emotion with his illustrations and drolleries. Figure 11 here is an example of this. The combination of
        Italian grisaille, Gothic Textura, and Strasbourg Cathedral make the page truly unlike other Book of Hourse preceding this one.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="imageHolder12">

        <div class="caption12">FIGURE 12: This picture is of the Tympanum of the central portal to the Strasbourg Cathedral in Strasbourg. Looking
        along the left side of the third line of stone-carved characters from the top, we can see the same scene of Jesus carrying the cross as
        Pucelle's in Figure 11. However, here, we have a full picture of the person whose arm is outstretched to help Christ carry the cross.
        As mentioned, this viewpoint was unique to Strasbourg at the time.</div>
    </div>

<div class="page eleven">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion">Erwin Panofsky depicts Parisian art as a “reservoir which developed through the mixing of
        different sources”. Who better to capture this, than Jean Pucelle, who integrates text and image in such a way to create
        new standard for Northern Gothic art, while maintaining an emphasis on the devotional aspect of the prayer book?
        Pucelle uses Italian spatial compositions and motifs, sculptures from Strasbourg and traditional Northern Gothic
        illustrations, marginalia and Textura to create a unique prayer book for a queen, without need of gold embellishment or gaudy
        adornment. His usage of grisaille sets him apart in the period and region, and produces a book which is, to this day,
        remarked as extraordinary and substantial for its time.</p>
